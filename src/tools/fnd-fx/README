                     The fnd.c and fx.c programs.


                              FND
                              FND
                              FND

FND uses the archiver log(s).  They must be presented to fnd in
chronological order:  the first line in the file must be the oldest
archive log entry.

Once you've gotten all the archiver logs together in one file (say, in
archiver.log), run:

     ./fnd < archiver.log > report

to produce the report file "report."  report looks like:

bilbo 98> ./fnd < archiver.log

"At line" identifies the line number in the input file where the error
occurred.

The next line is the line as read from the input file.

The third line contains the error message.  The messages are detailed
below.

Next comes the corrected archiver log, for your visual examination.

Finally, the last line contains a unix command line you can execute to
repair the problem.  The arguments for fx are described below in the
"fx" section.

                              THE POSSIBLE MESSAGES
                              THE POSSIBLE MESSAGES
                              THE POSSIBLE MESSAGES

o   Line doesn't have 11 fields.  Skipping

    Each input line is expected to have 11 fields.  Whenever the
    archiver archives a filesystem's root directory, it fails to use
    "." as the pathname.  Instead it has "".    The line is skipped.

o   Malformed offset.position, missing '.':%s

    The offset.position value lacked a period.  The line is skipped.

o   Too many vsns: %d

    The compiled in limit on the number of VSNs was reached.  The 
    program exits.

o   Position decremented!  %s was %llx.%llx(size %lld), now %llx.%llx
    This error cannot be corrected.

    The position number on the current line is less than the position
    of the last-seen line for this VSN.  This probably indicates that
    the VSN was relabeled.  The error cannot be corrected because the
    tape itself is "corrupt".  (This error can be suppressed by not
    giving the -r option.  STK tapes generate spurious errors of this
    type because of their use of the high-order bit as a "wrap" indicator)

o   This file also bad.

    The position of this file is the same as the previous file on this
    VSN, but that file had an offset overflow problem.  So, this file
    is also bad.  

o   Offset duplicated!  %s was %llx.%llx(size %lld), now %llx.%llx

    The position.offset of this file is identical to the position.offset
    of the previous file on this VSN.

o   Offset decremented!  %s was %llx.%llx(size %lld), now %llx.%llx

    This is the error that this program was written to detect.  It
    occurs when the offset field overflows, giving the appearance that
    this file's offset is smaller than the previous file's.


                                 FND OPTIONS
                                 FND OPTIONS
                                 FND OPTIONS

There are two options to fnd:

    -f  Only display the first error for each position value.  This
        suppresses the "This file also bad." errors.

    -r  Enable the "Position decremented!" errors.  Some tapes, like d2,
        seem to frequently have positions which begin with "ffffffff".
        These confuse the comparison logic.  By default the test is
        disabled, but to do a through job, this option should be selected.

                                     FX
                                     FX
                                     FX

fx (fix) is the program which repairs the inodes which fnd finds have
incorrect offset values.

fx reads lines from standard input.  Each line describes one repair.
The fields on these lines are:

     filename     (relative to current directory)
     copy number  (1-4)
     position_u   (upper 32 bits of position)
     position     (lower 32 bits of position)
     offset       (offset)

The numbers can be in any base:   decimal   0octal   -or-  0xhex

Note that, before running fs, you must "cd" to the filesystem which
you'll be modifying.

The program works by simulating a samfsdump/samfsrestore sequence on
each file.  The filename is used to get the id, the id is used to get
the full inode (using IDSTAT), the file is removed, the fields of the
inode are modified according to the arguments, and a samfsrestore is 
done, recreating the file, now with the correct values.

Example:

bilbo# cd /sam1
bilbo# ls
dir0        dir3        dir6        dir9        filec       filef
dir1        dir4        dir7        filea       filed       fileg
dir2        dir5        dir8        fileb       filee       lost+found
bilbo# sls -D filed
