# samservicetag add|delete
#
# add - Determines which (QFS only or SAM-QFS) package is installed
#   and adds the appropriate service tag to the repository using the
#   CLI interface "stclient".  This is called from mount or samd config
#   time.
#
# delete - Deletes all QFS or SAM service tags from the service tag
#   repository.  This is called at package delete time.
#
# In all cases, if service tags is not installed on the system, this
# command is a noop.
