$ *************************************************************************
$ *		Modification guidelines
$ *
$ *		It is good practice to not reuse message numbers, rather use a new
$ *		message and mark the old message as "** NOT USED **", while retaining
$ *		the old text. Cleanups of the "NOT USED" should be part of a release
$ *		process.
$ *
$ *		Making identical changes to the message catalog on the intended and
$ *		forward (future) release trees can prevent numbering conflicts from
$ *		occurring.
$ *
$ *		Do not include comment lines consisting of a single "$".  Linux
$ *		considers this an error.  Either leave the whole line blank or
$ *		use "$ *".
$ *
$ *		Hyphens can be used to skip message text. If the first character of
$ *		a message is a "-", all the text up to and including leading spaces
$ *		is skipped. Example (all the spaces before "this text" are also
$ *		skipped):
$ *		-thistextisskipped       this text is not
$ *
$ * The following comments also appear before message 18000.
$ The messages in the range 18000 - 18020 are sent via SendCustMsg()
$ In addition to these, there are other messages which have been identified as
$ events for which a SNMP trap is to be thrown. They are also sent using
$ SendCustMsg()
$ They may be preceded by an optional delivery code string that begins with
$ '-'.  The letters may be in any order and may be one of the following:
$     N - Send message to notify executable file.
$     S - Send message to syslog
$     V - Send trap notification.

$ The first letter of the syslog priority codes -
$     Emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug
$ The default action is: -Si
$ Example: -SNw  sends a "warning" to both syslog and the notify executable.
$ With the 'V' option, the class and subclass information for that event
$ is given as -wV[Class:Subclass]
$ e.g.
$ 4010 -wVN[Archiver:NoVolAvail] No volumes available for Archive Set %s
$ A trap notification would be sent; class= Archiver, Subclass= NoVolAvail
