.SH NAME
sambcheck \- Lists block use for a Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS, or Sun \%SAM-QFS file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsambcheck\fR
\fIfs_name\fR
\fIblock_num\fR[\fB.\fIord\fR]\fR
\fR[\fIblock_num\fR[\fB.\fIord\fR]\fR]
\fR\&.\&.\&.
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWqfs\fR
.PP
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsambcheck\fR command determines the current usage of each
requested \fIblock_num\fR in a Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun
StorEdge \%SAM-FS, or Sun \%SAM-QFS
file system.  This command must be run as root.
For accurate results, the file system should be unmounted.
.PP
This command accepts the following arguments:
.TP 10
\fIfsname\fR
The family set name, as specified in the \fBmcf\fR file,
for the file system for which the usage list is desired.
.TP
\fIblock_num\fR
A number that identifies the
blocks for which statistics should be obtained.
Blocks are in \%1024-byte (1 kilobyte) units.
Use one of the following formats:
.RS 10
.TP 2
\(bu
Decimal.  Default.
.TP
\(bu
Octal.  The \fIblock_num\fR must be preceded by \fB0\fR.
.TP
\(bu
Hexadecimal.  The \fIblock_num\fR must be preceded
by \fB0x\fR or \fB0X\fR.
.RE
.PP
.TP 10
\fIord\fR
The partition number (ordinal) upon which the block
use is to be found.  If no \&\fB.\fIord\fR is specified, all 
partitions are examined.  All \fIord\fR specifications are
assumed to be in decimal.
.SH OUTPUT
The output from this command is one line per requested block number
for each explicit or implicit ordinal.
The block number is displayed
as entered, followed by its decimal form in parentheses, followed by
text indicating the usage determined for
the \fIblock_num\fR[\fB\&.\fIord\fR].
