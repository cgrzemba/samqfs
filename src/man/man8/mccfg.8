.SH NAME
mccfg \- Media Changer Configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/tools/mccfg
.PP
.SH AVAILABILITY
.LP
SUNWsamfs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmccfg\fR command is a \%two-part Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS media
changer and tape drive installation configuration script.
.PP
The first part configures \fB/kernel/drv/sgen.conf\fR lun 0 fc-fabric media
changers.
.PP
The second part configures \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR for both parallel and
fc-fabric SCSI media changers, media changer installed tape drives, and 
standalone tape drives.  Media changer installed tape drives are put in
the required \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR ascending order for proper
Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS 
operation. A historian is also be added to the \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR.
Missing device information in either
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/inquiry.conf\fR or \fB/kernel/drv/st.conf\fR
produces a warning.
.PP
Multipath devices are supported where the first path seen is used in the
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR configuration.
.SH LIMITATIONS 
\%Network-attached media changer installed tape drives are configured as
standalone tape drives.  The user must create
the \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR
virtual library entry and change the standalone tape drive's family set
to that of the virtual library's.
.PP
Parallel \%SCSI-2 media changer and installed tape drives need to be on the
same SCSI bus for automatic configuration.  However, a single bus is not a
requirement of Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS, and better performance is
achieved with multiple buses.
.PP
A media changer which is lun 1 fc-fabric WWN must be manually
\fB/kernel/drv/sgen.conf\fR configured because of \fBcfgadm\fR
and \fBluxadm\fR limitations.
.PP
For automatic configuration to work, all removable media equipment must be
able to be opened and respond to a USCSI commands.
.SH FILES
.TP 10
\fBmcf\fR
The configuration file for Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS environments.
.SH NOTES
Run \fBsamd config\fR for \fBmccfg\fR changes to take effect.
