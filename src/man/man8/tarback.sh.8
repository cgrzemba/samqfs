.SH NAME
tarback.sh \- Reloads files from Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS archive tapes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/examples/tarback.sh\fR
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtarback.sh\fR
script reloads files from Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS archive tapes.
This script can be used if a file system is lost and there are no
usable \fBsamfsdump\fR(8) files or copies of the \&\fB.inodes\fR
files available.
.PP
.SH USAGE
The following steps describe how to use the \fBtarback.sh\fR script.
.TP 10
Step 1.
Use \fBsammkfs\fR(8) to recreate
or restore the file system.
.TP
Step 2.
Use \fBsamu\fR(8) to set the drive you are using to \fBunavail\fR.
.TP
Step 3.
Copy the script from its
original location in \fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/examples/tarback.sh\fR
to the \fB/tmp\fR directory or to a different alternate location.
The script itself contains comments to guide you in
tailoring the script for your own use.
.TP
Step 4.
Modify the variables you need.
Generally, only the
following variables in the script need to be modified:
.RS 10
.TP 20
\fBVariable Name\fR
\fBContent\fR
.TP
\fBEQ="\fIeq\fB"\fR
The Equipment Number of the tape drive as defined in the \fBmcf\fR
file.
.TP
\fBTAPEDRIVE="\fIpath\fB"\fR
The raw path to the device described by \fBEQ=\fR.
.TP
\fBBLOCKSIZE="\fIsize\fB"\fR
The block size in \%512-byte units.  For example, specify \fB256\fR
for a block size of 128 kilobytes.
.TP
\fBMEDIATYPE="\fImt\fB"\fR
The \%2-character media type for this tape as defined on
the \fBmcf\fR(5) man page.
.TP
\fBVSN_LIST="\fIvsn1 vsn2 \&.\&.\&.\fB"\fR
The list of VSNs to be read.  There is no limit on the number of
VSNs that can be specified.  Use a space character to separate
the VSN names.  This list can be continued onto another line by
using a backslash character (\\).
.sp
For example:
.sp
.ft CO
.nf
VSN_LIST="vsn1 vsn2 \\
  vsn3"
.fi
.ft
.RE
.TP 10
Step 5.
Remove the pound character (\fB#\fR)
from column 1 of the line that defines the variables.
.TP
Step 6.
