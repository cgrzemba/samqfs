.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B load
requests that the volume specified by \fIeq\fP:\fIslot\fP[:\fIpartition\fP] or
\fImediatype\fP.\fIvsn\fP  be loaded
into device \fIdeq\fP.  The device specified by \fIdeq\fP must be 
a removeable media drive, be
in the "unavailable" state (see
.BR set_state (8))
and be controlled by
a media changer.  
If \fIdeq\fP already has a volume loaded, it is unloaded and
the volume is put away before the new volume is loaded.
If \fIdeq\fP is not specified, then
the volume is loaded into an available drive in the media changer \fIeq\fP.
The Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file system
choses the drive that the volume is loaded into.
.PP
Note: Loading media used by a
Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file system
for archiving could result
in the loss of the data contained on that media.  Sun Microsystems strongly
recommends that archive media \fBNOT\fP be loaded in this manner.
.LP
The load and samload commands are identical; samload is provided as
an alternative to avoid conflict with the Tcl command of the same name.
