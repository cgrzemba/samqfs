.SH AVAILABILITY

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B sam-fsd
initializes Sun StorEdge \%SAM-QFS environments
and performs tasks 
for the file system kernel code. 
These tasks include sending messages to syslog, and starting the archiver,
releaser, shared fs, and stager daemons.
It is managed as a service by the Solaris Service Management Facility
.BR smf (5)

.LP
When started,
.B sam-fsd
reads the configuration files
.BR defaults.conf ,
.BR diskvols.conf ,
.BR mcf ,
and
.B samfs.cmd
located in the directory
.BR /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs .
These files may be changed at any time while
.B sam-fsd
is running.  The changes will take place when
.B sam-fsd
is restarted, or sent the signal SIGHUP.
.LP
The filesystems are configured and necessary daemons are started.
Configuration parameters are set, and table files are written for use by
other components of Sun StorEdge \%SAM-QFS environment.

.LP
If errors occur in any of the configuration files,
.B sam-fsd
refuses to run and writes a notification message to
.BR syslog .
The problem must be corrected, and the signal SIGHUP sent to
.BR sam-fsd .
.B sam-fsd
then rereads the configuration files.  The
.B syslog
message contains the command necessary to signal
.B sam-fsd .
 'kill -HUP
.IR sam-fsd-pid '
.SS Trace Files
.LP
Several Sun StorEdge QFS, and Sun StorEdge \%SAM-QFS
daemons write messages to trace files.
These messages contain information about the state and progress of the
work performed by the daemons.  The messages are primarily used by Sun
engineers and support personnel to improve performance and diagnose problems.
As such, the message content and format are subject to change with bugfixes
and feature releases.

The daemons writing trace files are:  \%sam-archiverd,
\%sam-catserver, \%sam-fsd,
\%sam-rftd, \%sam-recycler, \%sam-sharefsd, and \%sam-stagerd.

To prevent the trace files from growing indefinitely, \%\fBsam-fsd\fR
monitors the size and age of the trace files and periodically
executes the script \fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/trace_rotate\fR.  This
script moves the trace files to sequentially numbered copies.
The script is executed when the trace file exceeds a specified
size, or age.  The size and age are specified in \fBdefaults.conf\fR.
If \fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/trace_rotate\fR does not
exist, \%\fBsam-fsd\fR performs no action.
