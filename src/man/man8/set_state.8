.SH NAME
set_state \- Set device state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/set_state
[
.B -w
]
.I state
.I eq
.SH AVAILABILITY
.LP
SUNWsamfs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B set_state
will change the state of a removable media device \fIeq\fP to \fIstate\fP.
If
.B \-w
is specified,
the command will wait for the operation to complete before
terminating. Note:
.B set_state
cannot be used to change a file system partition's allocation state.
.LP
The valid states are:
.TP 8
.B on
The device is usable by Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file systems.
A device moving to the \fBon\fP
state will be unloaded if there is media mounted.
.TP
.B idle
The device will not be selected for use by either Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS
 file systems.  Any existing activity
will be allowed to complete.  Once there is no more activity, the device will
be placed in the \fBoff\fP state.
.TP
.B unavail
The device is unavailable for use by Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS file systems
and most Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS commands.
The only valid commands for a device in this state are
.BR load (8),
.BR unload (8),
and
.BR set_state (8).
A device moving to the \fBunavail\fP state will be unloaded
if there is media mounted.
.TP
.B off
The device is unusable by Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS file systems.
A device moving to the \fBoff\fP
state from \fBon\fP, \fBidle\fP or \fBunavail\fP will
be unloaded if there is media mounted. The only state a \fBdown\fP
device may be moved to is \fBoff\fP.
