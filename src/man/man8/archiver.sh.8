.SH AVAILABILITY

.SH DESCRIPTION
The archiver executes the
.B /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/archiver.sh
script when it encounters abnormal
or exceptional events.  You can substitute a \%site-specific
version of this script by using the archiver's \fBnotify\fR
directive in the \fBarchiver.cmd\fR(5) file.
.PP
For all events, the
.B /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/archiver.sh
script logs events to
.B syslog
using the
.B /usr/bin/logger
command.  In addition,
the 
\fBemerg\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBcrit\fR, and \fBerr\fR
keywords generate email to the root account, echoing the message
string.
.SH OPTIONS

with the following arguments:

The name of the program that is calling this script.
.TP
\fIpid\fR
The process ID of the program that is calling this script.

level of the event.  The keywords are as follows:
