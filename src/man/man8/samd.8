.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsamd\fR utility starts up or shuts down the \%\fBsam-amld\fR daemon,
or shuts down the \%\fBHSM daemons\fR for HA-SAM failover.
This utility can also be used to reinitialize the Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS,
and Sun \%SAM-QFS configuration files and allow changes to take effect.
.SH OPTIONS
This command accepts the following options:
.TP 10
.B  buildmcf
Creates a new \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR file if one does not exist.
This is useful when configuring shared clients for the first time, after
the file systems have been created on the metadata server.  Only
disk devices will be discovered and entered into the mcf.
.TP 10
.B  config
Causes the \%\fBsam-fsd\fR daemon to (re)configure based
on changes to the \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR, \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/archiver.cmd\fR,
and \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/defaults.conf\fR files.
.TP 10
.B  start
Starts up the \%\fBsam-amld\fR daemon if the \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR
file exists and the \%\fBsam-amld\fR daemon is not already running.
Implemented only in Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS environments.
Not a valid argument in a Sun StorEdge QFS environment.
.TP 10
.B  stop
Kills the \%\fBsam-amld\fR daemon.
Implemented only in Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS environments.
Not a valid argument in a Sun StorEdge QFS environment.
.TP 10
.B  hastop
Kills the \%\fBsam-archiverd\fR, \%\fBsam-stagealld\fR, \%\fBsam-stagerd\fR
and \%\fBsam-amld\fR daemon for HA-SAM failover.
Daemons killed by 'hastop' will not be restarted by the \%\fBsam-fsd\fR.
Implemented only in Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS environments.
Not a valid argument in a Sun StorEdge QFS environment.
