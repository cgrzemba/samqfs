.SH NAME
sefreport \- Displays the content of the System Error Facility (SEF) log
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/sefreport\fR
\%[\fB\-v|-t\fR]
\%\fB\-d\fR
\%\fIfile\fR
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsefreport\fR command 
reads the content of a Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS SEF log file
and writes its output
to \fBstdout\fR in a \%human-readable format.
By default, the log file
is \fB/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/sef/sefdata\fR.
The SEF log file contains the data gathered from the log
sense pages of peripheral tape devices used by Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS
and Sun \%SAM-QFS file systems. 
For more information on the SEF log file, including
its content and format, see the \fBsefdata\fR(5) man page.
.PP
The \fBsefreport\fR command reads the input file specified by
the \fIfile\fR argument.
If no other options are specified,
the \fBsefreport\fR command examines the SEF log file and generates
the following information for each record contained in \fIfile\fR:
.TP 2
\(bu
The first header line states the record number,
which is its ordinal position in the file.
.TP
\(bu
The second header line contains the timestamp of the record,
the vendor name of the device from
which the log sense data was received, the product name of the device,
the revision level of the device's firmware, the
string \fBVSN\fR, and the Volume Serial Name (VSN) of the volume
mounted in the device
when the log sense data was generated.
.PP
Following the header lines, the log sense data for each page in the record
is printed.  For each log sense page, a line identifying the page code
is printed, followed by a line of column headings.  The data is then
printed in three columns per line with the following headings:
parameter code, control, and
parameter value.  All data is generated in hexadecimal notation.
For the meanings of
the parameter codes, control bits, and parameter values, see your
vendor
documentation for the specific device.
.SH OPTIONS
This command accepts the following options:
.TP 5
\fB\-d\fR
Includes additional device information.
For each record, the command generates a third header line
that identifies the equipment number
of the device as configured in the \fBmcf\fR file and the path name of the
device.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Generates log sense output with text descriptions.
On each line of log sense data output, an additional string containing
the equipment number, page code, VSN, and parameter code description is
printed.  The -t option is not used when the -v option is specified. 
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Generates verbose output.
On each line of log sense data output, an additional string containing
the equipment number, page code, and VSN is printed.  This string is
enclosed in parentheses and the items are \%colon-separated.
.SH OPERANDS
This command accepts the following operand, which must be
specified:
.TP 10
\%\fIfile\fR
Specifies the SEF log file.
The SEF log file can be read from its default
location (\fB/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/sef/sefdata\fR)
or it can be redirected to another file for SEF processing.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1.
Assume that your system is set up to write SEF values
to file \fB/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/sef/sefdata.mid\fR.
You have entered the following
command to write the SEF data using the report formatter:
.PP
.ft CO
.nf
srvr# sefreport /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/sef/sefdata.mid > ~mydir/sef.short
.fi
.ft
.PP
The file \fB~mydir/sef.short\fR is as follows:

Example 2:
Assume that you also need to produce a report with additional data.
You can use the same log file as in Example 1, but
you want this report to contain more
information than \fBsef.short\fR, so you
invoke \fBsefreport\fR with the \fB\-d\fR and \fB\-v\fR options.
The following
command is entered:
.PP
.ft CO
.nf
srvr# sefreport -d -v /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/sef/sefdata.mid > ~mydir/sef.long
