.SH NAME
ssi_so \- The StorageTek (STK) ACSAPI client daemon.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBssi_so\fP is a shared object version of the SSI daemon supplied
by STK.  This daemon is the interface that \fIsamfs\fP uses
(see
.BR stk (8))
to communicate with the ACSLM.  
.LP
The ssi needs a number of parameters set to communicate with
the ACSLM.  These parameters are set through shell environment variables.
To allow the most flexibility in setting these variables, a shell script
(\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/ssi.sh\fR)
is used by the stk daemon (see
.BR sam-stkd (8)),
to start a \fBssi_so\fR daemon.  In general, most sites should not need to
change the variables within this script.
