.TH scsi_trace_decode 8  "07 Jan 2009"
.SH NAME
scsi_trace_decode \- Decodes files produced by enabling the \fBtrace_scsi\fR option
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/tools/scsi_trace_decode\fR
\%\fB-f\ \fItrace_file\fR
[\fIeq_id\fR]
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWsamtp\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBscsi_trace_decode\fR command decodes the raw SCSI trace file
produced when the \fBdebug trace_scsi\fR option
in the \fBdefaults.conf\fR file
is enabled.  
.SH OPTIONS
This command accepts the following options:
.TP 10
\fB-f\ \fItrace_file\fR
Specifies the trace file.  Enter a full path name for the trace file.
Typically, the trace file is \fB/tmp/sam_scsi_trace_\fIml_eq_id\fR,
where \fIml_eq_id\fR is the Equipment Number of the library
that contains the devices being traced.
.sp
For example, assume that you have two libraries.
Their Equipment Numbers are 20 and 50.
Each library has two tape drives, and their Equipment Numbers
are 21, 22, 51, and 52.
You could specify that trace information for devices 20, 21, and 22 go
to file \fB/tmp/sam_scsi_trace_20\fR and that trace information for
devices 50, 51, and 52 go to file \fB/tmp/sam_scsi_trace_50\fR.
.TP
\fIeq_id\fR
Shows entries in \fItrace_file\fR for the device identified
by Equipment Number \fIeq_id\fR only.
The default is to show entries for all Equipment Numbers in this trace file.

\fBMeaning\fR
.TP
\fBeq41\fR
The equipment number involved in the command or completion.
.TP
\fBIssue\fR
The scsi command has been issued.
.TP
\fBReply\fR
The command completed.  Completion status is shown.
.TP
\fB09:22:45\fR
The time of day when the command was sent or received.
.TP
\fB8\fR
The file descriptor upon which the command was issued.
Not useful for \%non-Sun Microsystems analysts.
.TP
\fBcdb\fR
The cdb (command descriptor block): the scsi command issued.
.TP
\fBsense\fR
The sense data.
If the command erred, then sense data is obtained and displayed.
If the command did not err, then this field is all zero.
.TP
\fBSense key \&.\&.\&.\fR
Decoded sense data, showing the sense key, additional
sense code, and additional sense code qualifier.
These values define the error that occurred.
.TP
