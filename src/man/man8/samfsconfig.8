.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsamfsconfig\fR utility
opens the \fIdevice\fR(s) listed on the command line,
attempts to read the Sun StorEdge \%QFS file system
superblock on each,
and generates output in a format similar to an
editable \fBmcf\fR(5) file.
A \fISun StorEdge \%QFS file system superblock\fR is a record that
the \fBsammkfs\fR(8) utility writes to the beginning of every
device in a Sun StorEdge \%QFS file system.
This record identifies the devices to the file system.
.PP
By default, the output is written to \fBstdout\fR, but the
output can be redirected to a file and edited
to regenerate the file system portions of the \fBmcf\fR file
in the event of a system reconfiguration or disaster.

\fBsamd buildmcf\fR executes samfsconfig to build the mcf file.
\fBsamd config\fR must be executed to reconfigure the changes
after the \fBsamd buildmcf\fR has built the mcf file.
.SH OPTIONS
This command accepts the following options:
.TP 10
\fB\-b\fR
Lists the size of the associated partition,
according to its superblock, in the last output column.
This may be useful when multiple disk partitions of different
sizes start at the same offset.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Generates detailed information about all the
Sun StorEdge \%QFS
superblocks found,
including the content of each superblock.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Generates a usage message and exits.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Print the host file contents of QFS shared filesystems.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Generates messages regarding the disposition of each \fIdevice\fR.
.TP
\fIdevice\fR
One or more \fIdevice\fR identifiers from which
configuration information is to be
recovered.
Use a space character to separate multiple \fIdevice\fR
identifiers on the command line.
.sp
It can be desireable to save a list of \fIdevice\fR identifiers to a file
and use this file for command line input to the program.
.PP
The \fBsamfsconfig\fR utility generates information about all the
Sun StorEdge \%QFS file systems and file system components it finds.
The file system name, creation time, generation, devices count, and
metadata devices count are listed.
The \fBsamfsconfig\fR utility flags irregularities as follows:
.TP 2
\(bu
For any incomplete devices that have superblocks, but are in
an file system where all the devices are not present, it prefixes
a pound sign (\fB#\fR) to indicate problems.
.TP
\(bu
For any duplicate devices that have the same superblock information
with the same file system generation number, it prefixes a
\%greater-than sign (\fB>\fR).
This is common if, for instance, multiple paths exist or whole disk
partitions are specified on the command line.
.TP
\(bu
For devices, one /dev/did/dsk and the other device /dev/dsk, which have the
the same superblock information with the same file system generation number,
it prefixes a \%greater-than sign (\fB>\fR) for the /dev/dsk devices.
This occurs for did file systems.
This line is only generated when the \fB\-v\fR option is specified.
.TP
\(bu
For any duplicate devices that have the same superblock information
but have different file system generation numbers, it prefixes a
\%less-than sign (\fB<\fR).
This can occur if a device has been removed from the file system and a
new device has been added to the same file system in the same ordinal
position. Note, the file system generation
number is incremented when a device is added to the file system.
This line is only generated when the \fB\-v\fR option is specified.
