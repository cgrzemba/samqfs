.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam-clfsd
loads the samfs and samioc modules into the operating system
if they are not already loaded, and updates or reports on
configuration information.
The options to sam-clfsd are:
.TP 10
.B -h
Print out a short usage message and exit.
.TP 10
.B -l
Report the names of all configured filesystems.
.TP 10
.B -f " fsname"
Compare the named filesystem with the listed
.B dev ...
devices, and
report any discrepancies, such as missing partitions,
partitions that don't belong to the named filesystem, etc..
.TP 10
.B -i " fsname"
Verify that the listed
.B dev ...
devices comprise the slices of the named filesystem,
and install and configure the filesystem.
.TP 10
.B -u " fsname"
Uninstall the named filesystem from the system's configured filesystems.
This command will fail on a mounted filesystem.
.TP 10
.B -d
Start up the sam-sharefsd daemon for the specified filesystem.
Useful only with the
.B -i
option.
After installing the filesystem, sam-clfsd forks off a child
that starts up the sam-sharefsd daemon.  If the daemon
exits with a non-fatal error, the restarting it
as necessary.  The command itself returns.
.TP 10
.B -w
Causes the sam-clfsd program to await a fatal error from
the sam-sharefsd daemon instead of returning immediately.
Useful only with the
.B -i
and
.B -d
options.
.PP
.B sam-clfsd
must be run as root.
