.SH DESCRIPTION
.B odlabel
labels the volume in the optical cartridge specified by 
.IB eq [ :slot:side ].
.I eq 
is the equipment number.
If
.I eq
is a library,
.I slot
is the slot in the library containing the cartridge.
.I side
is the side (1 or 2) of a two-sided cartridge.
.LP
A
.B VOL
(volume) and a
.B PAR
(partition) label are written.  These labels conform to ISO standard
IEC13346.  The data portion follows ISO standard TC97SC23.
.LP
.BI \-vsn " vv..."
specifies the volume serial name of the optical disk being labeled (up to 31
characters).
.LP
If the media being labeled was previously labeled, the VSN must be specified
by
.B \-old
.IR vv... .
The "old" VSN is compared with the VSN on the media to assure that the
correct media is being relabeled.
.LP
If the media is not labeled (i.e., blank),
.B \-new
must be specified to prevent the previous label comparison from being made.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10   
.BI \-info " aa..."
Specifies the "Implementation Use" string in the label (up to 127 characters). 
.TP
.B \-V
Verbose, lists label information written. 
.TP
.B \-erase
Erases the media completely before a label is written.  This is a security
feature that is normally not necessary.  Complete media erasure will take
a long time to perform since all data in the media is erased.
.TP
.B \-w
Wait for the labeling operation to complete.  If an error occurs, it will be
reported along with a completion code of 1.  All labeling errors are also
logged.  Note:  Canceling a command that is waiting for completion will not
cause the operation itself to be canceled.
