.SH NAME
clri \- clear inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clri
[
.BI \-F " samfs"
]
[
.B \-V
]
.I mount-point i-number

.SH AVAILABILITY

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clri 
writes zeroes on the inode numbered
.I i-number
on the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file
system currently mounted on
.IR mount-point .
.I i-number 
can be expressed as either a decimal integer, an octal integer 
prefixed with a zero, or a hexidecimal integer prefixed with \fB0x\fR.
.LP
.B clri
must be run as root.  Once you've cleared all the inodes you wish
for a filesystem, you'll need to unmount and remount the filesystem to
flush the inode cache to disk.  Finally, if there are any directory
entries which point at the newly-cleared inodes, those directory entries
will be cleared automatically by the filesytem the first time they
are referenced.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
Here's an example of using clri:

     Mount the filesystem

bilbo# mount /sam1                            

     Find out the inode number which must be cleared.  Here, let's say
     we would like to clear "file0."

bilbo# cd /sam1/test
bilbo# sls -i
   169 file0     166 file3     339 file5      60 file7     160 file9
   342 file2      63 file4     163 file6     336 file8

      Ok, now we have its inode: 169.  Let's clear it!

bilbo# /opt/SUNWsamfs/tools/clri /sam1 169

      But, look!  It's still there!  Sure looks weird, though...

bilbo# sls -l file0
----------   0 root     root             0 Dec 31  1969 file0

      Even "sync" doesn't help...

bilbo# sync
bilbo# sls -l file0
----------   0 root     root             0 Dec 31  1969 file0

      ...until we unmount and remount the filesystem.

bilbo# cd /
bilbo# umount /sam1
bilbo# mount /sam1
bilbo# cd /sam1/test

      This is actually what clears the directory entry:

bilbo# ls -l file0
file0: No such file or directory

      And, now it's gone!

bilbo# ls -l
bilbo 64
