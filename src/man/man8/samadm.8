.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBsamadm\fR command is a single command line interface to many
QFS commands.  Initially, it contains commands that are new to QFS 5.0,
but will in the future contain subcommands for most QFS administrative
functions.
.LP
The detailed description of each subcommand follows.

\fBservicetag\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fIadd\fR operand to the \fBservicetag\fR subcommand
adds service tags to the service tag
repository depending upon which QFS or SAM
package is installed.  If the SUNWqfs package
is installed, a QFS service tag is added.  If
the SUNWsamfs package is installed, both a QFS
and SAM-FS service tag is added.  See \fBstclient\fR(8)
for more information on service tags.
.LP
The \fIdelete\fR operand to the \fBservicetag\fR subcommand
deletes both QFS and/or SAM service tags from the service tag repository.
.LP
The \fBservicetag\fR subcommand is not intended to be needed to
be invoked by the administrator.  QFS automatically adds service tags
when first configured or mounted, and deletes service tags when the
QFS or SAM package is removed.

\fBeq-add\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This subcommand adds an equipment to an existing mounted
QFS file system.  The equipment must be added to the \fBmcf(5)\fR
file, and \fBsamd config\fR must be run prior to adding the equipment
number to a file system.  The equipment will be placed into the
\fIoff\fR state.
.LP
In a non-shared file system, after the equipment number is added,
it is placed into the \fIon\fR state.
.LP
In a shared file system, after the equipment number is added,
it is initially placed into the \fIunavail\fR state. All the mcf files
on the clients must be updated to include the new/changed equipment
number, and \fBsamd config\fR run. After this has been done, To place this
equipment number into full read/write status, change the state
to \fIalloc\fR via \fBsamadm eq-alloc eq_number#\fR.

\fBeq-release\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This subcommand releases the disk space associated with files that
have valid archive copies from SAM.  It can be used prior to an
\fBeq-remove\fR command to quickly release space on a device that
is to be removed for hardware failure or other reasons.
.LP
The \fBeq-release\fR subcommand starts a background process called
\fIsam-shrink\fR which releases space on the equipment number
The releasing process may take some time to complete.  Progress can be
monitored via \fBsamu(8)\fR (m display).  When the release is started,
the equipment is first put into \fInoalloc\fR state to prevent further
data allocation on that equipment.  When the releasing process is
complete, the equipment is placed into \fIoff\fR state if all space was
successfully released.

\fBeq-remove\fR

.sp .6
.RS 4n
This subcommand removes an equipment number from an existing mounted
QFS file system.  It is intended to be used to remove an equipment
for reuse, or to remove an equipment that needs replacement because
of hardware failure.
.LP
The \fBeq-remove\fR subcommand starts a background process called
\fIsam-shrink\fR which copies the data on the equipment number
to be removed to other equipments in the file system.  The removal process
may take some time to complete.  Progress can be monitored via
\fBsamu(8)\fR (m display).  When the remove is started, the equipment to be
removed is first put into \fInoalloc\fR state to prevent further data
allocation on that equipment.  When the removal process is complete,
the equipment is placed into \fIoff\fR state if all space was successfully
moved to other equipments.

.RS 4n
This subcommand changes the state of an equipment number to \fIalloc\fR
which allows new data allocations to be placed on it.  This subcommand is
only legal for equipments which are currently in the \fInoalloc\fR or
\fIunavail\fR state.
