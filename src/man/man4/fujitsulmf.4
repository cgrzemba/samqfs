.SH NAME
fujitsulmf \- The Fujitsu LMF Automated Tape Library
.SH AVAILABILITY
.LP
SUNWsamfs
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfujitsulmf\fP is the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS software interface
to the Fujitsu LMF library.
This interface utilizes the LMF interface supplied by Fujitsu.
For more information on LMF, see the LMF MTL Server/Client User's Guide
supplied by Fujitsu.
.SH CONFIGURATION
It is assumed that the site has the LMF server configured and 
operating with the LMF library.
.LP
The "equipment identifier" field in the \fBmcf\fP file, (see
.BR mcf (5)),
is the full path name to a parameters file used by \fIfujitsulmf\fP.  This file
consists of a list of keyword = value pairs or a keyword
followed by a drivename = value
pair.
All keywords and values are case-sensitive and must be entered
as shown.
.TP
.I lmfdrive
There is one \fIlmfdrive\fP line for every drive assigned to this client.
Following the \fIlmfdrive\fP keyword is a drivename = path, where:
.LP
.RS
.TP
.I drivename 
is the drivename as configured in LMF.
.TP
.I path 
is the pathname to the device.
This name must match the "equipment identifier" of an
entry in the \fBmcf\fR file.
.LP

Here are sample parameters files and mcf entries 
for an LMF library.

.SH IMPORT/EXPORT
Since the physical adding and removing 
of media in the LMF library is done with
LMF utilities, the import/export commands will only
affect the library catalog.  The
.B import
command has an optional
parameter (see
.BR import (8))
(\fB\-v\fR) for supplying the volser to be added.
\fIfujitsulmf\fP will verify that LMF knows about the volser
before updating the catalog with the new entry.  The \fBexport\fP command (see 
.BR export (8))
will remove the entry from the catalog.
.SH CATALOG
There are two utilities used to maintain the library catalog used by
LMF.
.B build_cat
(see
.BR build_cat (8))
is used to build the
catalog.
.B dump_cat
(see
.BR dump_cat (8))
and
.B build_cat
together are used to change the size of the catalog. 
.LP
To initialize a catalog with 1000 slots run:
.LP
.RS
build_cat /tmp/catalog_file < /dev/null
.RE
.LP
then move /tmp/catalog_file to the path pointed to in the mcf file for
this media changer.
Use import to populate the catalog with the volumes allowed
by DAS.  Or, you can create a file with the list of volumes and supply 
it as input to \fBbuild_cat\fP (see
.BR build_cat (8))
for the format
of the input file.
.LP
If the size of the catalog needs to be increased, execute something
like:
.LP
.RS
dump_cat file1 | build_cat -s 2000 /tmp/file2
.RE
.LP
This would create a new catalog file (/tmp/file2) with room for 2000
entries and initialize it with the entries from file1.  This should
only be done when the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS software is not running
and \fBsam-amld\fP has
been shutdown (see
.BR sam-amld (8)).
