.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsegment\fR command sets the segment attribute for an existing file.
At a minimum, the \%\fB\-l\ \fIsegment_size\fR and the \fIfilename\fR
must be specified.
If a file is segmented,
it is archived to and staged from its volumes
in \fIsegment_size\fP chunks.
.PP
When file attributes are set on a directory, files and directories
subsequently created in that directory inherit those attributes.
.PP
The \fBsegment\fR command is not supported in
Sun StorEdge SAM-QFS shared file systems
(\fBmb\fR).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-d
Returns the segment attributes on the file to the default.
When \fB\-d\fP is specified, attributes are first
reset to the default, then other attribute-setting options
are processed.  It not possible to reset a file that has
already been segmented.
.TP
.B \-f
Suppresses errors.
.TP
\%\fB\-l\ \fIsegment_size\fR
Specifies the segment size.  The \fIsegment_size\fR must be an integer
and must be greater than or equal to one megabyte.
The integer specified must be followed by \fBk\fR (for
kilobytes), \fBm\fR (for megabytes), or \fBg\fR (for gigabytes).
For example:
.sp
\fB\-l 1024k\fR
.sp
This segment size specifies the size at which the file is segmented
on the file system for archiving and staging.
A file is segmented when it reaches the specified segment size.
If a file has already been segmented, the segment size cannot be changed.
A pre-existing file cannot be segmented if it exceeds the
specified segment size.
.sp
.TP
.BI \-s " stage_ahead"
Specifies the number of segments to stage ahead when staging a
segmented file.
This means when an offline segment is read, in
addition to staging the current segment, the
next
.I stage_ahead
segments are also staged. The default value of
.I stage_ahead
is zero, which means there is no stage read ahead. The maximum
.I stage_ahead
value is 255.
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively sets the \fBsegment\fR file attribute for all files
contained in the specified \fIdirname\fP or its subdirectories.
.TP
.B \-V
Enables the verbose display.  Displays a message for each file on
which attributes are set.
.SH NOTES
The file system disables quotas at mount time if any of the
following files in the file system's root directory are segmented:
.TP 3
\(bu
\&\fB.quota_a\fR
.TP
\(bu
\&\fB.quota_g\fR
.TP
\(bu
\&\fB.quota_u\fR
.PP
The \%\fB\-drives\fR directive in the \fBarchiver.cmd\fR file
specifies the number of drives to use for archiving and staging.
.PP
The mmap function cannot be carried out on a segmented file.
Because of this, a segmented file cannot be an executable binary.
.PP
Segmentation of files is not supported on a Sun StorEdge SAM-QFS
shared file system.
.PP
A segmented
file is automatically striped across several volumes when it is
archived if the following conditions are in effect:
.TP 3
\(bu
More than one drive is available.
.TP
\(bu
The \fB\-drives\fR directive is in effect.
.PP
A segmented
file is automatically striped from several volumes when it is
staged if the following conditions are in effect:
.TP 3
\(bu
The file was archived as striped.
.TP
\(bu
More than one drive is available.
.TP
\(bu
The \fB\-drives\fR directive is in effect.
