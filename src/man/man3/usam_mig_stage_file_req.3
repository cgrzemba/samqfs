.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B usam_mig_stage_file_req(\|)
is the stage request routine for the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS Migration Toolkit.
The foreign data migration program 
adds this stage request to an internally-generated worklist
being maintained by third party API.
This worklist should be processed by a thread
started by \fBusam_mig_initialize(\|)\fR.
This worklist is processed by a program
started with \fBusam_mig_initialize()\fR.
The thread finds and positions the media to stage the file through
\fBstage_api\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
A successful stage request returns a value of 0.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is passed to the file system.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B usam_mig_stage_file_req(\|)
fails if the following is true:
