.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_getcatalog(\|)
obtains a range of entries from the catalog of an automated library or the 
historian.  The catalog from which entries will be obtained is indicated by
.IR cat_handle .
.IR cat_handle
is similar to a file descriptor, and is returned from a previous call to
.B sam_opencat(\|).
The range of entries is indicated by
.IR start_entry
and
.IR end_entry .
.IR start_entry
must be less than or equal to
.IR end_entry ,
and must be in the range of valid slot numbers for the automated library (or historian).
.I buf
is a pointer to an array of
.B sam_cat_ent
structures, into which the catalog entry information is placed.  This
array should be large enough to hold the number of entries requested.
.I entbufsize
is the size of a single
.B sam_cat_ent
structure, usually indicated by sizeof(struct sam_cat_ent).
.PP
The contents of a
.B sam_cat_ent
structure include the following members:

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion the number of catalog entries obtained is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_getcatalog(\|)
fails if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 20
.SB EBADF
The catalog handle provided is invalid.
.TP
.SB EFAULT
.B buf
is an invalid address.
.TP
.SB EOVERFLOW
The catalog library software returned more information than was requested.
.TP
.SB ENOENT
This is no longer an active catalog.
.TP
.SB EINVAL
The buffer size provided is invalid, or
.B start_entry
or
.B end_entry
is invalid.  (Either
.B start_entry
is less than zero,
.B end_entry
is greater than the number of entries in the catalog, or
.B start_entry
is greater than
.BR end_entry .)
