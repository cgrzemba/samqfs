.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_mig_create_file(\|)
creates an offline Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file from a foreign
(non- Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS) media.
.B sam_mig_create_file(\|)
creates an offline file using information supplied by a foreign data
migration program.  The information used to identify the location of the
file is stored in the file inode in the archive record.
.PP
Note that the program calling this function is responsible for creating all
directories in the path
.I before
calling the function.
.PP
.I path
is the pathname to the file to be created.
It may be an absolute or relative pathname but must be no longer
than PATH_MAX (see the
.B /usr/include/limits.h file).
.PP
.I buf
is a sam_stat structure (see \fBsam_stat\fR(3)).
.PP
The following members in the \fBsam_stat\fR structure must
be filled in.  All other fields are ignored.
.PP

.PP
.TP 10
.B position
Any 8 bytes that the 3rd party media program requires.
.TP
.B creation_time
This is the time that the archive was made.  If
.B creation_time
is zero, it will be
set to the value of \fBtime()\fR.
.TP
.B offset
Any 4 bytes that the 3rd party media program requires.
.TP
.B vsn
This is any 31 characters.  The 32nd character must be a zero byte.
Other utilities may require this to be a valid VSN.
.TP
.B media
The second character of the two character media type.  If this field is zero,
then this copy does not contain any archive information and will be ignored.
At least one of the entries must contain information.
.sh "RETURN VALUES"
Upon succesful creation of a file a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
