.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_mig_stage_write(\|)
passes data from the foreign data migration program
to the file system for the stage associated with \fIstage_req\fR
(see \fBsam_mig_stage_file\fR(3)).
\fIstage_req\fR
is the number of this stage request.  \fIbuffer\fR is a pointer
to the data that needs to be transferred.
\fIlen\fR is the number of bytes of data to transfer.
\fIoffset\fR is the offset from the beginning of this stage request.
This is not the offset from the beginning of the file (keep in mind 
stage_never).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B sam_mig_stage_write
returns the actual number of bytes written.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned.
If an error is returned,
.B sam_mig_stage_end
should still be called.
The only function allowed on
.I stage_req
after an error is \fBsam_mig_stage_end\fR.
