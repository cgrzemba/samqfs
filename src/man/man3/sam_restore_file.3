.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_restore_file(\|)
creates an offline file in a Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or
Sun \%SAM-QFS file system.
.B sam_restore_file(\|)
creates an offline file using information supplied by the user and
obtained from a source such as the \fBarchiver.log\fR file.
The file must not exist.
.PP
Note that the program calling this function is responsible for creating all
directories in the path
.I before
calling the function.
.PP
.I path
is the pathname to the file to be created.
It may be an absolute or relative pathname but must be no longer
than \fBPATH_MAX\fR (see the
.B /usr/include/limits.h file).
.PP
.I buf
is a \fBsam_stat\fR(3) structure (see \fBsam_stat\fR(3)).
.PP
.I bufsize
is the size of the \fBsam_stat\fR(3) structure (see \fBsam_stat\fR(3)).
.PP
The following members in the \fBsam_stat\fR(3)
structure must exist.  All other fields are ignored.

.B position
The position of the file recorded on the media.
.TP
.B creation_time
This is the time that the archive was made.  If
.B creation_time
is zero, it will be
set to the value of \fBtime()\fR.
.TP
.B vsn
The volume serial name of the cartridge where the file resides.
.TP
.B media
The two character media type. See \fBmcf\fR(5). For example, the media
type for DLT tape is \f4lt\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon succesful creation of a file a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a negative value is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
The possible return values are:
