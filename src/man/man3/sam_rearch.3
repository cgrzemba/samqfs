.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sam_rearch(\|)
sets rearchive attributes on a file or directory using a Sun
StorageTek \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS system call.
.I path
is the file on which to set the attributes,
followed by a sequence of 
.I num_opts 
input characters or options.
Individual options are described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBc\fI copy_no\fR
Specifies the archive copy number.
If one or more \fB'c'\fR options are specified,
only those archive copies (1, 2, 3 or 4) are marked. 
If not specified, the default is all copies only
in the case that media type and VSN are
specified, using the \fB"m\fI media\fR" option and \fB"v\fI vsn\fR" option. 
.TP
\fBM\fR
Rearchives metadata only. This includes directories, the segment index,
and removable media files. Regular files and symbolic links are not rearchived.
.TP
\fBm\fI media\fR
Specifies the media type.
If specified, archive copies on the specified media are marked.
This option must be specified in conjunction with
the \fB"v\fI vsn\fR" option.
For more information on media types, see the \fBmcf\fR(5) man page.
.TP
\fBo\fR
Requires the file to be online before its archive entry is rearchived.
If the file is offline, the function
stages the file onto disk before rearchiving any entries.
.TP
\fBv\fI vsn\fR
Marks archive copies on VSN \fIvsn\fR for rearchiving.
This option must be specified in conjunction with
the \fB"m\fI media\fR" option.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
