.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sam_export(\|)
requests the robotic media changer to place the selected media that belongs
in
.I ea
or is labeled with
.I vsn
into the mail-slot of the media changer.  Either the
.I vsn
or the
.I ea
must be specified.  The
.I vsn
should be set to a NULL pointer if
.I ea
is specified.  The
.I ea
should be set to
.B ROBOT_NO_SLOT
if the
.I vsn
is specified.
.PP
The call will return immediately after issuing the command if zero is
specified for
.I wait_response
value.  Other values for
.I wait_response
will give undefined results.
.PP
For network-controlled media changers such as the GRAU using the GRAU ACT
interface, IBM 3494, or Sony libraries using PSC, this interface only
removes the entry from the catalog.  Physical removal and addition of media
within these media changers is performed by utilities supplied by GRAU, IBM,
and Sony. For STK network-controlled media changers using ACSLS, 
this interface removes the entry from the catalog only if zero is 
specified for 
.I one_step
value. Other values for
.I one_step
will cause the physical removal of media and also remove the media from
the catalog.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon succesful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_export(\|)
fails if one or more of the following are true:
