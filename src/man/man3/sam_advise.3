.BI "const char *" "ops" );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_advise(\|)
provides advice about expected behavior of the application when
accessing data in the file associated with the open file descriptor,
.I fildes.
.B sam_advise(\|)
provides advice for a file using a \%SAM-QFS ioctl call.
The last caller of sam_advise() sets the advice for all applications
using the file.
The last close of the file sets the advice back to the default mode.
.I ops
is the character string of options, for example:  "dw".  Individual options are
described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B b
Advises the system to use buffered (paged) I/O.
The default I/O mode is buffered (uses the page cache).
At the last close, the type of I/O is set back to paged or direct
based on the mount option
.BR forcedirectio
or the
.BR directio
attribute set by the
.BR setfa
command.
.TP
.B d
Return the advice on the file to the default,
i.e. the \f4qwrite\fP is reset to the mount setting.
When this option is specified, the advice is reset to the default.
If it is used, it should be the first character in the string.
.TP
.B p
Obsolete.  Now does nothing, but remains for compatibility.
.TP
.B r
Advises the system to use direct (raw) I/O (see directio(3C) for
Solaris 2.6 and above).
The default I/O mode is buffered (uses the page cache).
At the last close, the type of I/O is set back to paged or direct
based on the mount option
.BR forcedirectio
or the
.BR directio
attribute set by the
.BR setfa
command.
.TP
.B w
Advises the system to enable simultaneous reads and writes to the
same file from different threads.
See the \f4qwrite\fP parameter on the mount command.
The
.B w
option is only supported by the \fIma\fP equipment
type file system.
(See man
.BR mcf (5)).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_advise(\|)
fails if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 20
.SB EINVAL
An invalid option was specified, or the file is not a regular file.
.TP
.SB EPERM

.TP
.SB EFAULT
.I path
or
.I ops
points to an illegal address.
.TP
.SB EINTR

.B sam_advise(\|)
function.
.TP
.SB ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.IR path .
.TP
.SB EMULTIHOP
Components of \f2path\f1 require hopping to multiple
remote machines
and the file system does not allow it.
.TP
.SB ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the
.I path
argument exceeds {\f4PATH_MAX\f1}, or the
length of a \f2path\f1 component exceeds {\f4NAME_MAX\f1} while
{\f4_POSIX_NO_TRUNC\f1} is in effect.
.TP
.SB ENOENT
The named file does not exist or is the null pathname.
.TP
.SB ENOLINK
.I path
points to a remote machine and the link
to that machine is no longer active.
.TP
.SB ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
