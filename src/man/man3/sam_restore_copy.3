.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsam_restore_copy()\fR library routine
creates an archive copy for an existing Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or
Sun \%SAM-QFS file.
The file must already exist and the archive copy must not exist.
The \fBsam_restore_copy()\fR library routine
creates an archive copy using information supplied by the user and
obtained from a source such as the \fBarchiver.log\fR.
This library routine accepts the following arguments:
.TP 10
\fIpath\fR
The path name to the file where the archive copy is being created.
It may be an absolute or relative path name, but it must be no longer
than \fBPATH_MAX\fR (see the \fB/usr/include/limits.h\fR file).
.TP
\fIcopy\fR
The copy number (0, 1, 2, or 3) of the archive copy that is being created.
.TP
\fIbuf\fR
A \fBsam_stat\fR structure.  See \fBsam_stat\fR(3).
.TP
\fIbufsize\fR
The size of the \fIsam_stat\fR structure.  See \fBsam_stat\fR(3).
.TP
\fIvbuf\fR
A \fBsam_section\fR structure for the array of VSNs if the archive
copy overflowed volumes, that is, \fBn_vsns\fR > 1.
If \fBn_vsns\fR = 1, \fIvbuf\fR should be set to NULL.
See \fBsam_stat\fR(3).
.TP
\fIvbufsize\fR
The size of the \fBsam_section\fR structure.
If \fBn_vsns = 1, \fIvbufsize\fR should be set to 0.
See \fBsam_stat\fR(3).
.PP
The following members in the \fBsam_stat\fR structure must exist.
All other fields are ignored.
.PP
.nf
ulong_t      st_mode      /\(** File mode (see mknod(2)) \(**/
ulong_t      st_uid       /\(** User ID of the file's owner \(**/
ulong_t      st_gid       /\(** Group ID of the file's owner \(**/
u_longlong_t st_size      /\(** File size in bytes \(**/
ulong_t      st_atime     /\(** Time of last access      \(**/
ulong_t      st_ctime     /\(** Time of last file status change \(**/
ulong_t      st_mtime     /\(** Time of last data modification  \(**/
.fi
.PP
The following members in the \fBsam_copy_s\fR structure must exist for the copy.
All other fields are ignored.
.PP
.nf
u_longlong_t position;    /\(** Position of the file on the media. \(**/
time_t       creation_time; /\(** Time the archive copy was created \(**/
uint_t       offset;      /\(** Location of the copy in the archive file \(**/
short        n_vsns;      /\(** Number of volumes used by the archive \(**/
char         media[4];    /\(** Two character media type. \(**/
char         vsn[32];     /\(** Volume serial name of the media volume \(**/
.fi
.PP
The preceding fields have the following meaning:
.TP 10
\fBposition\fR
The position of the file recorded on the media.
.TP 10
\fBcreation_time\fR
This is the time that the archive was made.  If \fBcreation_time\fR
is zero, it is set to the value of \fBtime()\fR.
.TP
\fBoffset\fR
The location of the copy in the archive file in units of 512 bytes.
.TP
\fBn_vsns\fR
The number of volumes that this copy spans.
.TP
\fBvsn\fR
The volume serial name of the cartridge where the file resides.
.TP
\fBmedia\fR
The \%two-character media type.
For example, the media type for DLT tape is \fBlt\fR.
See \fBmcf\fR(5).
.SH RETURN VALUES
Upon succesful creation of a file, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a negative value is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
The possible return values are:
.nf
.TS
tab (%) ;
 l l .
-1%user is not root
-2%invalid copy number
-3%invalid VSN
-4%file does not exist
-5%file open failed
-6%uid and gid do not match those for the existing file
-7%invalid VSN for this copy
-8%multiple copies but vbufsize incorrect
-9%media type invalid
-10%copy restore failed for some other reason
