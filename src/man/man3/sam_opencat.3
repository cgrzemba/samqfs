.BI "size_t " "bufsize" );
.SH AVAILABILITY
32-bit programs only
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_opencat(\|)
initiates access to the automated library catalog pointed to by
.IR path .
The string which
.IR path
points to is limited to 127 characters.
It returns a
.B sam_cat_tbl
structure in the area pointed to by
.I buf .
.I bufsize
is the length of the user's buffer to which
.I buf
points.  This should be equal to or greater than sizeof(struct sam_cat_tbl).
.PP
The user may have access to at most MAX_CAT catalogs at any one time.
.PP
The contents of a
.B sam_cat_tbl
structure include the following members:
.PP

.PP
Following the call to
.B sam_opencat(\|),
entries in the library catalog are obtained using
.B sam_getcatalog(\|).
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion, a catalog "handle" is returned, which is an
integer equal to or greater than zero.
.PP
This "handle" is used on subsequent calls to
.B sam_getcatalog(\|)
to specify the catalog to access, and is also used by
.B sam_closecat(\|)
to deallocate the "handle" and end access to the catalog.
.PP
If the call to
.B sam_opencat(\|)
fails, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_opencat(\|)
fails if one or more of the following error conditions are true:
.TP 20
.SB EMFILE
The user already has access to MAX_CAT catalogs , or the process has too many
open files.
.TP
.SB EINVAL
.I bufsize
is set to an invalid value, or either
.I path
or
.I buf
is a null pointer.
.TP
.SB ER_UNABLE_TO_INIT_CATALOG
This process was unable to initialize the catalog data.
.TP
.SB ENOENT
There is no active catalog file with the name given.
