.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sam_devstat(\|) and sam_ndevstat(\|)
obtain information about the device identified by the equipment number,
.IR eq .
.PP
.I buf
is a pointer to a
.B sam_devstat(\|) or sam_ndevstat(\|)
structure into which information
is placed concerning the device.
.PP
.I bufsize
is the length of the user's buffer to which
.I buf   
points.  This should be equal to or greater
than \fBsizeof(struct sam_devstat)\fR
or \fBsizeof(struct sam_ndevstat)\fR.
.PP
The contents of the structure pointed to by
.I buf
include the following members for 
.B sam_devstat(\|)
:

.TP 10
.B type
The type of the media.  Masks for interpreting media type are defined in
devstat.h.
.TP
.B name
The name of the device, such as \fB/dev/rmt/3cbn\fR.
.TP
.B vsn
The VSN of the mounted volume, if any.  This is a \%null-terminated string with
a maximum of 31 characters.
.TP
.B state
The state of the device.  This field is an enumerated type defined in devstat.h.
.TP
.B status
The status of the device.  Status bits are defined in the file devstat.h.  Also,
the library routine
.BR sam_devstr (3)
is available to translate the numeric status field into a character string as
displayed in the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or
Sun \%SAM-QFS graphical user interfaces
and in the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS administrative tool
.BR samu (8).
.TP
.B space
The space left on the device, in blocks.
.TP
.B capacity
The capacity of the device, in blocks.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_devstat(\|) or sam_ndevsat(\|)
fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 20
.SB ENODEV
The equipment number supplied is not a valid number, or no device is
configured with that equipment number.
.TP
.SB EACCES
The program does not have permission to access the
Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS
shared memory segment.
.TP
.SB EINVAL
The size of the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or
Sun \%SAM-QFS shared memory segment is incorrect.
You may need to recompile your program with the current version of
the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS software.
.TP
.SB ENOENT
Access to the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS
shared memory segment has failed;
possibly Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS is not running.
.TP
.SB EMFILE
The Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or
Sun \%SAM-QFS shared memory segment could not be accessed
because the number
of shared memory segments attached to the calling process would exceed the
\%system-imposed limit.
.TP
.SB ENOMEM
The available data space is not large enough to accommodate access to the
Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS shared memory segment.
.TP
.SB E2BIG
For 
.B sam_devstat(\|)
only.  The name field of the device was too long
to fit in the name field of the \fBsam_dev\fR structure.  Use 
.B sam_ndevstat(\|).
