.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sam_set_fs_contig(\|)
sets the maximum number of contiguous blocks that can be read or written to
a mass storage device in the family set at equipment number
.I eq_number.
The value for
.I max_contig
can be from 1 to 128.  The default value is 8.  The block size is 16384
bytes.
.PP
The call will return immediately after issuing the command if
zero is specified for
.I wait_response
value.  Other values for
.I wait_response
will give undefined results.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon succesful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B sam_set_fs_contig(\|)
fails if one or more of the following are true:

device is not a family set device.
.TP
.SB ER_FIFO_PATH_LENGTH
