.SH NAME
samaio \- Pseudo Device Driver for AIO
.SH AVAILABILITY
SUNWqfsr SUNWsamfsr
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The pseudo driver, \fBsamaio\fR, allows you to attach a QFS file to a
character device, which can then be accessed through that device.
\fBsetfa -q\fR attaches a QFS file to \fBsamaio\fR. When you open a file
with the \fB-q\fR attribute set,
you use the character device.
\fBSamaio\fR translates access to the character device into I/O on the
underlying QFS file. This is useful for aio because raw device I/O is
faster than file system aio.
.LP
\fBSamaio\fR is controlled through \fB\/dev/samaioctl\fR - this is the only
device exported during attach, and is minor number 0. QFS communicates
with \fBsamaio\fR through ioctls on this device. When a file is attached to
\fBsamaio\fR, character devices are exported in \fB\/dev/rsamaio\fR. These
devices are identified by their minor number. Minor devices are tracked
with state structures handled with ddi_soft_state(9F).

The command \fBls\fR displays a character device for files 
with the \fB-q\fR attribute set,
The command \fBsls\fR displays a regular file with its current length
for files with the \fB-q\fR attribute set,
