.SH NAME
fsalogd.cmd \- Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS fsalogd command file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/fsalogd.cmd\fR
.SH AVAILABILITY
SUNWsamfs
.SH DESCRIPTION
Directives for controlling the file system activity log daemon (sam-fsalogd)
can be read from the
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/fsalogd.cmd\fR file.
The directives must appear one per line.
.PP
Comment lines are permitted.  Comment lines must begin with a
pound character (\fB#\fR), and the comment can extend through the
rest of the line.
.PP
Directives that appear prior to any \fBfs=\fR directive
are applied to all file systems.
Directives that appear after a \fBfs=\fR directive are applied
to the specified file system only.
Directives that are specific to a file system override general
directives.
.PP
The following directives control the operation of the fsalogd daemon.
.RE
.SH DIRECTIVES
The following miscellaneous directives can be specified in
the \fBfsalogd.cmd\fR file:
.TP
.B "log_path = " \fIn\fR
Specifies the path of the log file directory.  The default is
/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/fsalogd/\fIfamily_set_name\fR.  Log files are created 
with the name \fIfamilyset.YYYYMMDDhhmm.log\fR.
.TP
.B "fs = " \fIfile_system_family_set_name\fR
Specifies that the subsequent directives apply to the
indicated \fIfile_system_family_set_name\fR only.
.TP
.B "log_rollover_interval = " \fIn\fR
Sets the log file rollover interval time to \fIn\fR seconds. When the
interval time since the creation of the log file has elapsed a new log file
will be created.  The default is 28800 seconds (8 hours).
.TP
.B "log_expire = " \fIn\fR
Sets the log file expiration time to \fIn\fR seconds. When the
time since the creation of the log file has exceeded log_expire,
the log file is eligible for deletion.  The default is 172800
seconds (48 hours).  Expired log files are checked every 
log rollover interval.
.TP
.B "event_interval = " \fIn\fR
Sets the event interval time used by SAM-FS to call out to sam-fsalogd with
accumulated events.  The default time is 10 seconds.
.TP
.B "event_buffer_size = " \fIn\fR
Sets the buffer size in events.  The default buffer size is 256K which is
about 8,000 events.
.TP
.B "event_open_retry = " \fIn\fR
Sets the number of allowable retries when sam-fsalogd is establishing its
connection with the file system.  The default retry count is 5.
.TP
Example 1.  This
example file sets the \fBevent_interval\fR and \fBlog_path\fR directive for
the \fBsamfs1\fR file system.
.ft CO
.nf

          fs = samfs1
          event_interval = 10
          log_path = /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/fsalogd/samfs1

.fi
.ft
Example 2.  This example specifies the \fIlog_path\fR
for each file system.
.ft CO
.nf

          event_interval = 10

          fs = samfs1
          log_path = /var/adm/fsalog/samfs1

          fs = samfs2
          log_path = /var/adm/fsalog/samfs2
