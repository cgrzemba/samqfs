.SH NAME

.br
subscriptions commands file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/notify.cmd
.SH AVAILABILITY
.LP
SUNWsamfs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Sun StorageTek \%QFS or Sun StorageTek \%SAM system has the
ability to inform a user of certain events or conditions
by generating a message and automatically sending email
notifications.

The /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/notify.cmd stores the email addresses
for the following notifications:
No space available on file system (ENospace),
Recovery Point warnings (DumpWarn),
Recovery Point errors (DumpInterrupted),
File System exceeded its high water mark (HwmExceeded),
ACSLS configuration warnings (AcslsWarn), and
ACSLS configuration errors (AcslsErr).
 
The email subscriptions are added, modified and deleted
only via the File System Manager software, a browser-based
graphical user interface to the Sun StorageTek \%QFS or
Sun StorageTek \%SAM software.

This file is created automatically after installation and 'root'
is assigned as the default subscriber for all notifications.

If you would like to add, modify or delete subscriptions,
use the Email Alerts feature in the File System
Manager software.

To preserve compatibility, the email subscriptions for
Archiving is Interrupted,
Recycling is complete,
Library or Tape drive is down and,
Requested volume is unavailable,
are automatically added to the
/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/archiver.sh (1M),
/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/recycler.sh (1M),
/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/dev_down.sh (1M),
and /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/scripts/load_notify.sh (1M) respectively.
.SH MANUAL EDITING
The /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/notify.cmd consists of the notification
type followed by the list of email addresses that have
subscribed to it.

Each notification type and its respective subscriber list are
space separated, while the email addresses are comma separated.

It is is highly recommended that you only use the File System
Manager software to add, modify, or delete subscriptions, but
if you must manually modify this file, take care to 
preserve the formatting of this file.
.SH EXAMPLE

The following is an example \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/notify.cmd\fP file:

.ft CO
    DumpInterrupted root, samadmin@xxx
    ENospace root
    HwmExceeded
.fi
.ft

The above entries indicate that root is to receive email notifications
if the File System is full or if errors are encountered when
taking recovery points.
There are no subscribers for the 'File System exceeded its
high water mark' notification.

To remove 'root' as a subscriber, the file should now read as follows:

.ft CO
    DumpInterrupted samadmin@xxx
    ENospace
    HwmExceeded
.fi
.ft
