.TH stager.cmd 5 "07 Jan 2009"
.SH NAME
stager.cmd \- Defines Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS stager directives
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/stager.cmd\fR
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Directives for controlling the Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS stager
are read from
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/stager.cmd\fR.
In the \fBstager.cmd\fR file, each directive must appear on its own line.
Each directive has the following format:
.PP
\fIkeyword\fR \fB=\fR \fIvalue\fR
.PP
Comment lines can appear in the \fBstager.cmd\fR file.
A pound sign (\fB#\fR) in column 1 indicates a comment line.
.PP
The \fBstager.cmd\fR file accepts the following directives:
.TP 10
\fBdirectio = \fIon|off\fR
Set the file reading method for staging. The directive \fIon\fR
will set direct I/O for all staging if file size is equal to or
greater than dio_min_size. \fIoff\fR will cause paged
I/O to be used. The default is on.
.sp 1
NOTE: Staging on a shared QFS file system always uses direct I/O.
.TP 10
\fBdio_min_size = \fIn\fR
If the file size is < \fIn\fR megabytes, the stager will use paged I/O for
non-shared QFS file systems. The default is \fI8\fR megabytes.
If directio = off all stage io is paged.
.sp 1
NOTE: \fBdio_min_size\fR is ignored for shared QFS file systems which
always use direct I/O.
.TP 10
\fBdrives =\fR \fIlibrary\fR \fIcount\fR
Sets the number of drives to use for staging
on media library \fIlibrary\fR to a number specified
by \fIcount\fR.
The default value is the actual number of drives in \fIlibrary\fR.
.sp
The \fIlibrary\fR specified must be the family set name
of a media library as defined in the \fBmcf\fR file.
If this directive is specified, the stager uses only \fIcount\fR
number of drives in the media library
to stage archive copies.
This directive prevents the stager from using all
drives in a media library and possibly interfering with archiving.
.sp
For example, the following directive specifies that 3 drives
should be used for staging in an ADIC/Grau media library.
.sp
.ft CO
drives = gr50 3
.ft
.TP
\fBbufsize =\fR \fImedia\fR \fIbuffer_size\fR [ \fBlock\fR ]
Sets the stage buffer size for a specific media type.
.sp
For \fImedia\fR, specify a media type from the \fBmcf\fR(4) man page.
.sp
For \fIbuffer_size\fR, specify an integer value in the
range \fB2\fR \(<= \fIbuffer_size\fR \(<= \fB8192\fR.
The default is \fB16\fR.
The \fIbuffer_size\fR specified is multiplied by the default block
size for \fImedia\fR.
For more information on default block sizes, see the
\fIdev_\fBblksize\fR description on the \fBdefaults.conf\fR(4) man
page.
.sp
If \fBlock\fR is specified, the stager locks the stage buffer
in memory.  If the stage buffer is locked, system CPU time can be
reduced.
.TP
\fBlogfile =\fR \fIfilename\fR [\fIevent\fR]
Sets the name of the stager log file to \fIfilename\fR,
specified as an absolute pathname.
By default, no log file is written.
\fIevent\fR is start, finish, cancel, error, or all.  The default
is finish, cancel, and error.
.sp
The stager log file contains a line for each file staged.
The line
contains the event type, date, time, media, VSN,
inode generation number of the file,
position and offset of where the file is stored,
name of the file, copy number, user id, group id, requestor's user id,
equipment number of the drive upon which the file was staged,
and the type of stage, 'V' for data verify and '-' for others.
.TP
\fBmaxactive =\fR \fInumber\fR
Sets the maximum number of stage requests that can
be active at one time in the stager to an integer \fInumber\fR.
The minimum \fInumber\fR is \fB1\fR.
The default \fInumber\fR is based on memory size, 5000 per gigabyte.
The maximum \fInumber\fR is \fB500000\fR.
.sp
The number of outstanding stage requests has a direct impact on incore inode
usage, since each request requires an incore inode for the duration of the
stage.
Sites may wish to increase the default number of incore inodes if they
greatly increase the maximum number of stage requests.
This can be done by setting \fBninodes\fR in the \fB/etc/system\fR file,
as shown in the following example.
.sp
set samfs:ninodes=100000
.sp
For more information on \fBninodes\fR, see the
\fISun StorEdge QFS Configuration and Administration Guide\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example \fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/stager.cmd\fR file:
.PP
.ft CO
.nf
logfile = /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/log/stager
drives= hp30 1
.fi
.ft
.PP
The results of the stager's operations are
found in \fB/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/log/stager\fR.
For the media library specified as \fBhp30\fR,
the stager is allowed to use only 1 drive
for staging files.
.SH FILES
The following files are used by the stager:
.TP 30
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/stager.cmd\fR
Stager command file.
