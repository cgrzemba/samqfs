.SH NAME
mcf \- Master configuration file for Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS, and Sun \%SAM-QFS software
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/mcf\fR
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.PP
\fBSUNWqfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmcf\fR file defines the devices and family sets used by
Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS, and Sun \%SAM-QFS software.
The \fBmcf\fR file is read when \fBsam\-fsd\fR
is started.  You can change it at any time while \fBsam\-fsd\fR
is running.  The changes take effect when \fBsam\-fsd\fR is restarted,
or sent the signal SIGHUP.
.PP
The following examples show
an \fBmcf\fR file for a Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS environment and an \fBmcf\fR
file for a Sun StorEdge QFS file system.

.PP
As the preceding examples show, each line in the \fBmcf\fR
file is divided into six fields.
The format of the fields in the \fBmcf\fR file is as follows:
.PP
.nf
.ft CO
Equipment  Equipment  Equipment  Family  Device  Additional
Identifier Number     Type       Set     State   Parameters
.ft
.fi
.PP
The \fBEquipment Identifier\fR, \fBEquipment Number\fR,
and \fBEquipment Type\fR fields are required for each entry.
The \fBmcf\fR file can contain comments.  Each comment line must begin
with a pound character (\fB#\fR).
Blank lines are ignored.
The fields in the file must be separated by white space.  A dash
character (\fB\-\fR) can be used to indicate a field with no entry.
.PP
This man page describes the content of a Sun StorEdge QFS, Sun
StorEdge \%SAM-FS, or Sun \%SAM-QFS \fBmcf\fR file.
For more configuration information,
see the \fISun StorEdge QFS and Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS
File System Administrator's Guide\fR.
After your Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS
software is installed, you can see more
examples of \fBmcf\fR files in the following directory:
.PP
.ft CO
\fB/opt/SUNWsamfs/examples\fR
.ft
.SH mcf File Fields
This section defines the fields in the \fBmcf\fR file.
Note that Sun StorEdge QFS environments do not
include removable media devices in their \fBmcf\fR files.
.PP
When writing the \fBmcf\fR file, group together the lines that define
similar devices.
For example, create this file such that the devices for a file
system appear on consecutive lines and devices for a library appear
in a separate set of consecutive lines.
.TP 2
\(bu
The \fBEquipment Identifier\fR
specifies a file system and its disk devices or it specifies the
devices associated with an automated library.
.RS 4
.TP 3
-
For file system definition lines, this field can contain
two types of entries.
The first line in a file system definition
must contain the file system name in the \fBEquipment Identifier\fR
field, and it must be no longer than 31 characters in length.
The file system name specified
must be identical to the content of the \fBFamily Set\fR field.
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft CO
Equipment    Equipment  Equipment  Family  Device  Addl
Identifier   Number     Type       Set     State   Params
----------   -------    ---------  ------  ------  ------
samqfs1      1          ms         samqfs1 -       -
.fi
.ft
.sp
\fRSubsequent lines in the \fBmcf\fR file define disk devices
to be included in the file system.  The \fBEquipment Identifier\fR
fields in these lines can be no longer than 127 characters in length.
.TP
-
For automated library definition lines,
the \fBEquipment Identifier\fR field contains
drive identifier information and can be
no longer than 127 characters in length.
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft CO
Equipment     Equipment  Equipment  Family  Device  Addl
Identifier    Number     Type       Set     State   Params
----------    -------    ---------  ------  ------  ------
/dev/rmt/0cbn 61         tp         9730    on      -
.fi
.ft
.sp
.RE
.TP
\(bu
The \fBEquipment number\fR field contains a unique number
for each disk or removable media device configured.
The number you specify must be in the following range:
.sp
1 \(<= \fIEquipment_number\fR \(<= 65534
.sp
Sun Microsystems recommends that you use low numbers
in order to keep the internal software tables small.
.TP
\(bu
The \fBEquipment Type\fR field contains a \%2-character
code that specifies the device being defined as either
a disk in a file system or as a removable media device.
This man page includes information on appropriate codes.
.TP 2
\(bu
The \fBFamily Set\fR name is an arbitrary name that you select
when the \fBmcf\fR is created.
This field can be no longer than 31 characters in length.
The \fBFamily Set\fR name defines and associates related
groups of devices.
This can be either a file system name, an automated library
identifier, or a dash character (-), as follows:
.RS 4
.TP 3
-
If it is a file system name, all disk devices in the file system must
use the same file system name in this field.
.TP 
-
If it is an automated library identifier, the library and all its
associated drive devices must use the same identifier.
.TP
-
If it is a standalone removable media device, use a dash (-)
character in this field.
.RE
.TP 2
\(bu
The \fBDevice State\fR field defines the default status
for the device at the time the system reads the mcf file.
Valid values
are as follows:  \fBon\fR (default), \fBoff\fR, \fBunavail\fR,
or \fBdown\fR.  This field is used for disk devices, libraries,
drives, and other devices.
.TP
\(bu
The \fBAdditional Parameters\fR field provides additional information.
It can contain the path to a
library catalog file, an interface file, or other configuration
information.  The \fBAdditional Parameters\fR field can be no
longer than 127 characters.  For example, this field can be
used to specify a nondefault location for the library catalog
file. If mcf file is being configured on a SunCluster node running
HA-SAM, this field must specify the library catalog file in
default location. In HA-SAM configuration /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/catalog
is linked to cluster filesystem which is shared among all nodes
within the SunCluster.
.SH File System Disks
When defining a disk cache family
set, the following entries differentiate a Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS file
system from a Sun StorEdge QFS or Sun \%SAM-QFS file system:
.TP 5
\fBms\fR
A Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS disk cache family set. There are no meta devices.
Metadata resides on the data device(s).
.TP
\fBma\fR
A Sun StorEdge QFS or Sun \%SAM-QFS disk cache family set with one or more
meta devices.
Metadata resides on these meta devices.
File data resides on the data device(s).
.PP
A maximum of 252 separate magnetic disk devices can be defined for each
\fBms\fP, \fBma\fP, \fBmb\fP, or \fBmat\fP disk cache family set.
.PP
The \fBFamily Set\fR field is required for file system disks.
It is used to define the magnetic disks that make up the family set.
For a magnetic disk device, the \fBFamily Set\fR field entry must match
a \fBFamily Set\fR defined on an \fBms\fR, \fBma\fP, \fBmb\fR, or \fBmat\fR
entry.
.PP
The keyword \fBshared\fR must be specified in the \fBAdditional
Parameters\fR field if the file system is a shared file system.
A \fBshared\fR file system is built by using the \%\fB\-S\fR
option to the \fBsammkfs\fR(1M) command. The \fBshared\fR option
is not supported for an \fBmat\fR file system.
For more information on this option, see the \fBsammkfs\fR(1M) man page.
.PP
For each disk device, the \fBEquipment Identifier\fR field
is the path to a special file, such
as \fB/dev/dsk/c\fIn\fBt\fIn\fBd\fIn\fBs\fIn\fR.
If the meta devices are not present on the clients
in a shared file system, the keyword \fBnodev\fR must be specified
in the \fBEquipment Identifier\fR field for the mm devices.
.PP
The following equipment types are used to define the disk devices that
reside within an \fBms\fR, \fBma\fR, \fBmb\fR, or \fBmat\fR file system:
.TP 7
\fBmm\fR
A magnetic disk that is part of an
\fBma\fR, \fBmb\fR, or \fBmat\fR disk cache family set.
Metadata is allocated on this device.
At least one \fBmm\fR device is required in an
\fBma\fR, \fBmb\fR, or \fBmat\fR file system.
.TP
\fBmd\fR
A magnetic disk that is part of an
\fBms\fR, \fBma\fR, or \fBmat\fR disk cache family set.
This device stores file data allocated in small Disk Allocation
Units (DAUs) of 4 kilobytes and large DAUs of 16, 32, or 64 kilobytes.
The default is 64 kilobytes.
In an \fBms\fR family set, this device stores both metadata and file data.
In an \fBma\fR or \fBmat\fR family set, this device stores only file data.
At least one \fBmd\fR or \fBmr\fR device is required in an
\fBma\fR or \fBmat\fR file system.
.TP
\fBmr\fR
A magnetic disk that is part of an
\fBma\fR or \fBmat\fP disk cache family set.
This device stores file data allocated in large Disk Allocation
Units (DAUs) that are a multiple of 8 kilobytes in a fully adjustable
range from 8 to 65528 kilobytes.  The default is 64 kilobytes.
File data is allocated on this device.
At least one \fBmr\fR or \fBmd\fR device is required in an
\fBma\fR or \fBmat\fR file system.
.TP
\fBg\fIXXX\fR
A magnetic disk that is part of an
\fBma\fR or \fBmat\fP disk cache family set.
The \fIXXX\fR identifies a striped group of devices.
This device stores file data allocated in a large DAU
size multiplied by the number of members in the striped group.
The DAU size is a multiple of 8 kilobytes in a fully adjustable
range from 8 to 65528 kilobytes.  The default is 256 kilobytes.
The \fIXXX\fR must be a decimal number in the
range \fB0\fR \(<= \fIXXX\fR \(<= \fB127\fR.
These devices
must be the same physical size.
.sp
It is not possible to use the \fBsamgrowfs\fR(1M) command
to increase the size of a striped group.
However, it is possible to add additional striped groups.
.PP
The \fBEquipment Identifier\fR is used during the \fBmount\fR(1M)
process as the \fBDevice To Mount\fR.  The \fBDevice To Mount\fR
is the first field in \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file for the mount point.  For
more information on this, see the \fBmount\fR(1M),
\fBmount_samfs\fR(1M), or \fBvfstab\fR(1M) man pages.
.SH \%SCSI-attached Libraries
Several identifiers can be used to define \%SCSI-attached
libraries in the \fBmcf\fR file.
For each \%SCSI-attached library,
the \fBEquipment Identifier\fR field must contain the path
(such as \fB/dev/samst/c\fIn\fBt\fIn\fBu\fIn\fR)
to the special file for the device created by the \fBsamst\fR
device driver.
For more information on the device driver, see the \fBsamst\fR(7)
man page.
.PP
The \fBFamily Set\fR field
is required.  It is used to associate the library controller with
the drives in the library.
All devices associated
with the library must have the same \fBFamily Set\fR name.
.PP
The \fBAdditional Parameters\fR field is optional.  This
field can be used to specify a nondefault location for the library catalog file.
By default, catalogs are written
to \fB/var/opt/SUNWsamfs/catalog/\fIfamily_set_name\fR.
This file is used to store information
about each piece of media in the library.
In HA-SAM configuration, this field must specify the library catalog
file in default location and /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/catalog is linked to
cluster filesystem which is shared among all nodes within the SunCluster.
.PP

.PP
If Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS or Sun \%SAM-QFS has access to a tape device,
no other user should be allowed access the device during
that period.
Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS and Sun \%SAM-QFS change the mode
on the path supplied in
the \fBmcf\fR file to \fB0660\fR at startup, or when the device state
moves from \fBdown\fR to \fBon\fR.
When the state moves from \fBon\fR to \fBdown\fR,
the mode is set to the value of \fBtp_mode\fR in
the \fBdefaults.conf\fR file.
For more information, see tbe \fBdefaults.conf\fR(4) man page.
