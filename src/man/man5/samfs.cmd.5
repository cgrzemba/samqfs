.SH NAME
samfs.cmd \- Defines mount parameters for Sun StorEdge \%SAM-FS, Sun StorEdge QFS, and Sun \%SAM-QFS file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/samfs.cmd
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBSUNWqfs\fR
.PP
\fBSUNWsamfs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Commands for controlling 
.B samfs
mount parameters are read from
.BR /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/samfs.cmd .
These commands serve as defaults, and can be superseded by parameters
on the mount command. See \fBmount_samfs\fR(1M). 
The
.B /etc/opt/SUNWsamfs/samfs.cmd
file is read when
.B sam-fsd
is started.  You can change it at any time while
.B sam-fsd
is running.  The changes take effect when
.B sam-fsd
is restarted,
or sent the signal SIGHUP via the \fBsamd config\fR command.
.PP
When changing mount options in this file, you must unmount and mount the file 
system in order for the new mount options to take effect.
.PP
These commands are given one per line.
Comments begin with a # and extend through the end of the line.
Commands given before any "fs =" line apply in general to all
filesystems; "fs =" introduces commands which are specific to the
mentioned filesystem only.  Filesystem-specific commands override
general commands.
.SH COMMANDS
See
.BR mount_samfs (8)
under OPTIONS for the list of supported commands.
The following additional command is available as well.
.TP
.BI "fs = " fs_name
This command specifies the following commands apply only to the
indicated file system with family set name \fIfs_name\fP.  
.SH EXAMPLE

samfs1 and samfs2.
