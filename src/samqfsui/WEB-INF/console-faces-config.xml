<!-- Managed bean descriptions for console applications
     that want to use the default bean implementations. 
     If you want to supply alternative data in lieu of 
     supplying it in app.xml you can do so by supplying 
     managed-property entries for the properties you 
     want to change, In that case use a separate 
     faces configuration file and do not include this one
     in your application -->
