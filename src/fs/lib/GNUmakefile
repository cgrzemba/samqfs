# bswap_data.c -- generated by running ./struct -s and prepending
# the copyright notices, CVS Id, &c.  Each structure element is an
# offset, a size, and a count of objects (of that size, starting
# at that offset) to be byte-swapped.  bswap_data.c is included
# by bswap.c; bswap.c is also included in src/fs/samfs/clmisc.c.
#
# struct -- generated from struct.c and decls.c.  Munges the
# collections of offsets and sizes defined in decls.c, and generates
# the offset/size/count triplets required for byte-swapping the
# structures of interest (sblks, hosts files, label blocks, ...).
# It complains about overlapping elements discovered in structures,
# and joins adjacent same-sized descriptor elements.
#
# decls.c -- generated by perl script and cc -E from desc.c,
# declares print/swap info for all structures of interest.
# Included by struct.c.
#
# desc.c -- Holds #includes for slurping in required structure
# structure definitions for gendesc.p to process.  Not compiled
# to binary (used only w/ cc -E), gendesc.p generates decls.c
# from it.
#
# data: dummy target to regenerate bswap_data.c, whose contents
# ultimately derive from various structures/include files in
# src/fs/include.  Save the old bswap_data.c away.
#
# compare: dummy target to compare bswap_data.c (which is kept
# in the source tree) to a generated version of the same.
# If they don't compare, we want the compile to blow up so
# that someone will have to check in an updated bswap_data.c.
# (Because this is generated for different machines and must
# be identical on all of them, we must not just generate
# bswap_data.c on the fly for each.)
