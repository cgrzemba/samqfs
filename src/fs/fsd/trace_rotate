#  trace_rotate tracefile
#
#  trace_rotate is intended to be executed by sam-fsd when a tracefile
#  has aged or grown to the limits specified by the trace controls.
#  trace_rotate moves the current tracefile to tracefile.0 and rotates
#  former tracefiles accordingly.  If tracefile.7 exists it is lost.
#
#    ex:  trace_rotate /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/trace/sam-archiverd
#
#  If desired, you can disable the sam-fsd action, and perform the rotations
#  by using cron.  In a crontab you could do the following:
#
# 10 3 * * 0  /opt/SUNWsamfs/sbin/trace_rotate /var/opt/SUNWsamfs/trace/sam-archiverd
#
