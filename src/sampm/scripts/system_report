# Synopsis: This script will take system information of user, system, and
#	wait I/O time and compare them to a threshold. If the threshold is
#	exceeded, it will echo out a WARNING to a log file that is placed in
#	the samfs file system under csd/year/month and the file will be tagged
#	with the date of when the script was run.
#
#       Process to enable system activity reporting:
#
#	Modify /etc/init.d/perf to enable system activity data gathering
#       vi /etc/init.d/perf
#		remove the # on every command line starting at the first
#		"if" command using "vi" as the editor.
#
#
#	Edit crontab entries for user sys,
#		MUST USE: "crontab -e sys" as the editor
#			remove the # on the three "sa" crontab commands
#			so they will run
#			This will modify /var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys
#
#       The system will log in binary file accounting information in directory
#                       /var/adm/sa. There is another script to move these
#			accounting files to /sam for safe keeping.
#
#

#   Obtain the site specific parameters
