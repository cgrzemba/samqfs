/*
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Function to initialize the library. This function needs to be called
 * before any other function in the library can be called. If other
 * functions are called before initializing the library, then the
 * function will return -1 (indicating an error).
 *
 * If the configuration functions of the API detect that the config files
 * have been modified(except by direct manipulation by the library instance)
 * since this function was called an error will be thrown.
 *
 * This error is really like a notification to the caller that the config
 * files have been changed due to external activity. Another call to this
 * function is required before the user can continue to interact with the
 * library without recieving continued errors.
 *
 * This resynchronize does NOT update any structs the user already has,
 * so the caller must decide wether to begin again by getting new
 * information from the api or trust any information they may currently
 * have and proceed where they left off prior to the error.
 *
 * PARAMS:
 *   ctx_t *	IN   - context object
 * RETURNS:
 *   -1		- error
 *    0		- success but reinitialization was not really required.
 *   > 0	- success and initialization was required.
