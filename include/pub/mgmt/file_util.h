 * DESCRIPTION:
 *	This function returns information about the status and location of
 *	the archive copies for the file specified in file_path.
 *
 *	e.g. non-segmented file on 1 vsn:
 *	copy=1,created=1130378055,media=dk,vsn=dk2
 *
 *	e.g output for a segmented file on 2 different vsns:
 *	copy=1,seg_count=3,created=1130289560,media=dk,vsn=dk1 dk2
 *
 *	each copy may also have a count of stale, damaged, inconsistent or
 *	unarchived. If any of these are returned the copy is not a valid
 *	candidate for staging.
 *
 *	damaged means the copy has been marked as damaged by the user with
 *	the damage command or by the system as a result of a fatal error
 *	when trying to stage. damaged copies ARE NOT???? available for staging
 *
 *	inconsistent means that the file was modified while the
 *	archive copy was being made. By default such a copy would not
 *	be allowed. However there is a flag to the archive command
 *	that allows the archival of inconsistent copies. inconsistent
 *	copies can only be staged after a samfsrestore. They are not
 *	candidates for staging in a general case. However, knowledge
 *	of their existence is certainly desireable to a user.
 *
 *
 * This function only returns aggregated information for segmented files
 * and thus will not return all fields for any segmented file.
 *
 * Likewise if any particular copy overflows into more than one vsn,
 * the information about the copy is aggregated.
 *
 * PARAMS:
 *   ctx_t *	IN   - context object
 *   char *	IN   - fully qualified file path

 *   list **	OUT  - Strings of key value pairs
 * RETURNS:
 *   success -  0
 *   error   -  -1
 *
 *
 * which_details is for future use it will allow collection of extened
 * information about all of the vsns on which a copy resides.
 * FLAG				Result
 * CD_AGGREGATE_VSN_INFO	a summary of information is included about
 *				all of the vsns used to archive each copy of
 *				the file. This means that position and length
 *				information which is on a per segment/section
 *				basis is not provided except for non-segmented
 *				files that do not overflow onto multiple vsns
 *				A single string will be returned for each
 *				copy.
 * CD_DETAILED_VSN_INFO		A string will be returned for each
 *				segment/section for each copy. If this option

/*
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *	Function to get a number of lines from a text file from a starting
 *	point.
 *
 *	The function has been written to avoid the need to malloc individual
 *	lines of text. Instead a data block is allocated to contain the
 *	actual text and an array of ptrs in to this block. Because of this
 *	instead of needing 2000 mallocs to hold 2000 strings, 3 will suffice.
 *	This design leads to the following usage patterns:
 *
 *	Local users must free only res and data when they are done with the
 *	strings. Local users should not free each of the strings pointed
 *	to by res.
 *
 *	RPC client users will recieve NULL for data but must free
 *	res and each of the strings it points to.
 *
 *	The returned array will contain one more element than the number
 *	of lines that was requested or one more than the number of
 *	lines in the file- if more lines were requested than exist in
 *	the file. The last element in the array is NULL.
 *
 * PARAMS:
 *	ctx_t *		IN	- context object
 *	char *		IN	- name of file to get lines from.
 *	int		IN	- the line at which to begin, first line = 1
 *	int *		IN-OUT	- IN: maximum number of lines to return,
 *				  OUT: number of lines being returned.
 *	char ***	OUT	- malloced array of ptrs to lines in file
 *	char **		OUT	- NOT PASSED ON REMOTE CALLS. malloced.
 *				  local users should not need to do anything
 *				  with data but free it when done with the res.
